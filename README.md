`eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver` is **a simple solution for most responsive images needs with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**.

This Eleventy plugin allows authors to **use the standard Markdown syntax for images** (`![alt text](image.jpg "title text")`) and yet **get responsive images in the generated HTML**, with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

# Why does this project exist?

As Steve Jobs [once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o):

> You've got to start with the customer experience and run backwards to the technology.

**Responsive images are one of the most difficult topics nowadays** for front end developers and content authors, they involve multiple features and syntaxes, but they are **required to provide a good performance to Web users**.

Most content authors should not have to learn the complex responsive images HTML syntax, and how it is used by browsers to load the right image for current viewing context.

Knowing that [`<picture>` is only required for rare advanced usages](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/), **`eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver` should be enough for most use cases**, known as Resolution Switching. Read [this article on Cloudfour's blog to know more of the theory](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-the-simple-way/).

# How does it work?

`eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver` is **the glue** between Eleventy plugin and transformations system and [`images-responsiver`](../images-responsiver/), the generic HTML transformation npm package for simple responsive images.

Eleventy uses Markdown-it to transform Markdown content into HTML, and then runs the transform added by `eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver`, which calls `images-responsiver` to actually transform the HTML.

> **Warning**
> This plugin doesn't generate any image, it has to be used either with already existing images, a local image resizing solution (should work with the official [eleventy-img](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) plugin), or a third party service ("image CDN") like Cloudinary.

# Alternatives

To deal with responsive images in Eleventy, there are multiple other plugins:

- [eleventy-img](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) by Zach Leatherman ([@zachleat](https://twitter.com/zachleat)) is a low level utility to perform build-time image transformations for both vector and raster images, but it doesn't generateany markup
- [eleventy-plugin-respimg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-respimg) by Eric Portis ([@etportis](https://twitter.com/etportis/)) provides a shortcode for responsive images with Cloudinary
- [eleventy-plugin-local-respimg](https://github.com/chromeos/static-site-scaffold-modules/tree/master/modules/eleventy-plugin-local-respimg) by Sam Richard ([@Snugug](https://twitter.com/Snugug/)) provides an Eleventy transform for resizing and optimizing local images
